title: "N-grams: The dumbest language models"
---

N-grams are some of the simplest language models out there, and are pretty easy to understand (compared to LLMs at least). In this article, I'll try giving you an inuitive understanding of N-gram LMs, while also explaining perplexity, an evaluation measure for such LMs, and also the inspiration for [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai)! Stay tuned for its release!
