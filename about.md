title: About

My name is Gautham, and I'm currently an intern at Couchbase working on AI integrations and developer experience. Most of my work is in machine learning, including my previous internships and projects. I've worked with a wide variety of classical and deep learning models, and have also deployed them for efficient inference on various platforms.

I'm interested in all things AI, particularly in NLP. I'm exploring embedding models currently, and am planning to get into LLMs and RL soon. I'm also interested in building agentic applications.
